This program was written for Byron Gao's CS 3378 Theory of Automata class at Texas State University. This program was written with my partner Elliot Esponda. This program searches the HTML of a webpage, using regular expressions, to gather specific data about faculty members on the Texas State CS Departments faculty web page.
